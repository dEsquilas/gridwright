 * `gw refine` — the corrective half of the loop.

 * never converges at all.
 *
 * The iteration cap is the other half of that. A loop that cannot say when to
 * stop will happily spend a whole budget circling a difference it cannot fix —
 * usually one that is not the component's fault in the first place.
