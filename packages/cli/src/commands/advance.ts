/**
 * Closing a stage — the other half of the protocol.

 * closes and the state machine is decorative: an agent would read a directive,
 * do the work, and have no way to record it, so the next `gw next` would hand
 * back the same stage forever.
 *
 * The transitions themselves live in core and enforce the order. This is only
 * the door.
