/**
 * Running as far as the CLI legitimately can.
 *
 * `gw build` used to chain exactly two stages because, when it was written,
 * exactly two existed. Stages were added around it and it never caught up, so
 * the help promised "as far as it goes" while the code stopped at `distill`.
 * This is the part that makes the promise true.
 *
 * It does not run everything, and that is not a gap to close later:
 *
 *   - a human gate stops it (Law 5) — nothing that mutates the project gets
 *     written because a loop happened to reach it
 *   - an `agent` stage stops it (Law 3) — writing a component that reads like
 *     the rest of the repo is not something a program does
 *   - a stage missing an input it cannot derive stops it, and says which one
 *
 * The point is that it stops for a stated reason rather than at an arbitrary
 * line in a function.
